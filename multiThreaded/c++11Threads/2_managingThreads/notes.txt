NOTES:
======
1) In case you use CMake to maintain your C++11 threading application, an elegant way to get CMake to link the proper
threading library when using C++11 std::thread is as foolows:

# get the OS specific threading library (needed for std::thread)
find_package(Threads REQUIRED)
...
...
...
target_link_libraries(managingThreadsExe Threads::Threads)

a) Run the programs:
--------------------
# server:
$ dotnet server.dll <server_ip> <server_port>

# cleint:
$ client.exe <server_ip> <server_port>

# There is a compilation flag (#define SEND_ASCII) in the top of the globalHeader.h file. Uncomment (and re-build) to run the client so that it will transmit ASCII characters.

Some general notes about the code:
=================================

1) The default behaviour of the client is to send UNICODE (16 bits coding) characters.
2) In places where I had to assume some assumption I added a "labal" written: ASSUMPTION
3) I tried to use a MACRO I usually use (NO_COPY) which is defined in the globalHeader.h file. It caused some compilation error which in order to solve it I found
   a proposal to use the "cpp.hint" file --> so this is the reason for its existence.
